ABSTRACT =
$(P "-betterC"?  "D runtime"?  There's been a lot of talk about the
potential of D to replace C for systems programming.  I'll explain what it
all means, in practical, concrete terms.  I'll show what works today, what
might be possible in the future, and what needs to be done to get there.
Extended Description: This talk will contain some background theory,
discussion of different approaches for systems programming in D, and
highlights of some real projects.)

BIO =
$(P Simon Arneaud is a consultant living in Sydney,
