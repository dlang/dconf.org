        <h1>DConf Online Round 4</h1>
        <p>
            The D Language Foundation invites you to join us for the fourth edition of DConf Online on March 16th, 2024! Spend the day with us on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDLanguageFoundation">the D Language Foundation&#8217;s YouTube channel</a>. It&#8217;s completely free. No registration is required; all you need is a web browser or the YouTube app, an internet connection, and a YouTube account if you wish to participate in the live chats.
        </p>
        <p>
            In past editions of DConf Online, we ran the livestream and the talks separately. This year, everything is happening in one place:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8GV_TuYk3lk?si=GOENDSVw6LFHT3Qe">The DConf Online &#8216;24 Livestream</a>.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Each talk will go like this:

            <ol>
              <li>The speaker will join Mike Parker in the livestream for a 10-minute chat about the talk.</li>
              <li>At 10 minutes past the hour, Mike will launch the talk in the livestream. Viewers will not need to switch away to watch it.</li>
              <li>The speaker will monitor the livechat while the talk plays and may type out short answers to any questions that come up or defer answering until after the talk.</li>
              <li>As soon as the talk ends, the speaker will stick around for 10 or 15 minutes to answer questions.</li>
              <li>When the Q&amp;A session is finished, Mike will announce a break until the top of the hour, when we goto 1.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>As with past editions, everyone who has a question answered during the Q&amp;A session will be entered into a drawing to win a swag item. They'll also be entered into a drawing at the end of the day to win a $100 Amazon eGift Card. So be sure to stick around to the end! The livestream link will be posted here and in <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D Announce forum</a> one week prior to the event.</p>

        <p>Mike will open The DConf Online &#8216;24 livestream at 14:55 UTC. <strong>Note that all times in the below schedule are in UTC.</strong></p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Átila Neves has a PhD in Particle Physics for research done at CERN. Most of the time spent there required programming in C++, with a two-year stint as a Perl programmer on the IT department's security team. He also worked for Cisco for almost seven years, developing networking software in C and C++ and leading his teams in the areas of software quality and testing. He now works as a D consultant/programmer for Symmetry Investments, as well as being the deputy maintainer of the D programming language. He spends his spare time yelling at the screen in frustration while waiting for computers to compile his code.</p>

Notice the word 'fast'—a favorite among game and graphics programmers—is used three times! In this talk I will show how the D programming language can be used for Graphics programming using OpenGL (And I’ll mention Vulkan too!). I’ll show a small graphics demo and highlight how the D programming language was used to make it easier to architect a graphics scene. Viewers of this talk will leave understanding how to setup a basic graphics application and a few tips on why Dlang could be their secret weapon for rapidly building high performance graphics applications.</p>

Since that fateful Google search, Mike has worked as a freelance game developer, worked in industry for Intel, Sony PlayStation, Oblong Industries, and researched at The Ohio Supercomputer Center to name a few. Mike cares about building tools to help programmers monitor and improve the performance of real time applications&mdash;particularly any visual multimedia. Mike believes computer science can be learned by all. Mike Shah completed his Ph.D. at Tufts University in 2017 and is an Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University. Mike also consults as a 3D Senior Graphics Engineer. In Michael&#8217;s spare time he goes for long runs, plays video games while on his exercise bike, learns guitar, and considers himself an amateur pizza and wine maker. <a href="https://youtube.com/c/MikeShah">Mike&#8217;s YouTube channel</a> covers various graphics and programming including Dlang!</p>

Also like most modern languages, the user-defined types are not quite as capable as the builtin ones. This talk is about removing probably the most talked about deficit with user-defined types.

He&#8217;s an expert in all areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation, interpreter engines, and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.</p>
