            <p>
                <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">Symmetry Investments</a> and the D Language Foundation are thrilled to invite you to the <b>D Programming Language Conference 2024</b> in London, from <b>September 17&ndash;20</b>. With help once more from <a href="https://brightspaceevents.co.uk">our friends at Brightspace Events</a>, we&#8217;re excited to return to our favorite venue, <a href="https://www.codenode.live">CodeNode</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                DConf is more than a conference; it&#8217;s a community celebration. It&#8217;s where DLang enthusiasts and experts from across the globe converge for four days of knowledge sharing, collaboration, and fun. Though our regular online meetups are valuable, they can&#8217;t replicate the connection and energy of in-person interactions, be it during engaging sessions, casual chats, or our nightly BeerConf.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned DConf veteran or joining us for the first time, we can&#8217;t wait to welcome you to London!

However, we aren&#8217;t dispensing with it entirely. We&#8217;ll be hosting an online AUA live stream at some point close to the DConf dates.

                                <p>Dub is an amazing tool, but due to its features not being segregated enough, it can be difficult to contribute to the project and to identify bottlenecks. Redub is a tool focused mainly on building. It brings compatibility with dub, faster build times, and rewards good project structure.</p>
                                <p>In this talk, I introduce the new tool and various aspects of its usage, including but not limiited to the motivation behind it, the base development plan, comparisons with dub and reggae, and more. My goal is to help D users discover new best practices that could benefit the entire D ecosystem, and to thing more about public and private dependencies.</p>

Web programming has always been all about compatibility, which motivated him to create Hipreme Engine, one of the biggest game engines made in D. He is also the developer of Redub, based on his experiences with Hipreme Engine, dub and other build tools outside of D.

Now I have a scheme that combines the best parts of the Garbage Collector and manual memory management. It&#8217;s <code>@safe</code>, it&#8217;s <code>@nogc</code>, and it&#8217;s implemented in only 80 lines of code. The gist of it is that pointers to arenas are passed to <code>return scope</code> function parameters with default arguments. How it works exactly will be explained in the talk.</p>

                                <p>In this talk, we show the key role of the D programming language in the development of a task-based parallel programming framework for a novel compute-accelerator platform. The platform consists of a set of compute accelerators (like GPGPUs) and a management processor. The management processor&#8217;s role is to orchestrate the parallel execution of kernels on the accelerators. Using the D language for the code running on the management processor allowed us to write high-level, size-efficient code.</p>

                                <p>The key features of D to achieve this are extensive use of templates, interoperability with the underlying FreeRTOS written in C, and <em>BetterC</em>. Since this is our first large project in D, we will also share some concrete highs and lows of using the language. Next to that, we discuss the generic user experience of D and lessons learned.</p>

                                <p>In D, certain high-level constructs are replaced with calls to lower-level functions from DRuntime, called hooks, that provide the same functionality. This makes the compiler&#8217;s job easier by saving it from having to generate code for complex expressions itself. This process takes place in the compiler&#8217;s intermediate representation generator. This has the following disadvantages:</p>
                                <div class="fauxlist">
                                    <p><strong>1.</strong> The hook arguments are mostly <code>void[]</code> and require the TypeInfo hierarchy to extract type information at runtime. This is unnecessarily slow because all type information is available at compile-time.</p>
                                    <p><strong>2.</strong> All hooks are linked into one large runtime library that all D programs link, regardless of which hooks they use. This makes DRuntime unnecessarily large for use cases where a subset of the hooks is used.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>This project eliminates these disadvantages by converting DRuntime hooks to templates and moving the lowering logic to the semantic phase. Thus, all new hooks are verified to respect the restrictions imposed by attributes, type information is leveraged at compile-time, and D executables will only contain code for the hooks they use. This brings performance benefits since runtime checks are moved to compile time.</p>

                                <p>In a world which can&#8217;t be stopped, we need a new hero. (Well, maybe we can stop it for a few microseconds...) In any case, the current garbage collector for D has been relatively stagnant in design since the development of DRuntime. We have had a few nice improvements, including fork-based, parallel scanning, and precise scanning. But we can do better. Our ideas on how to improve the performance of the GC get down to the lowest level of the hardware of modern systems, and try to squeeze every last bit of performance from the GC.</p>
                                <p>This talk will delve into the details of why we need a new garbage collector, and how we can exploit modern memory and CPU architecture and use clever storage techniques to streamline GC allocations.</p>

This could be used for research, educational purposes, and fun. It was written purely in D. I&#8217;m striving to make it the best biology simulator in the world. Come watch my talk to learn more. I will talk about some evolutionary concepts such as RND, DNA, natural selection, and biophysics, and I will be demonstrating the software as I explain in detail how it all works.

Ranges are a big part of Phobos, and they are are being reworked as part of the update.</p>

                                <p>Overall, ranges have worked very well for us since they were first introduced in Phobos v2. We would like that continue, but there are some issues with their current design which have come up over the years.

                                <p>In this continued presentation about the new GC, we will talk about how we organize small allocations to reduce fragmentation, how we avoid lock contention when allocating, and how we optimize collections to take as little time away from your code as possible. We will also talk about integration with DRuntime and planned future improvements that can bring this new allocator further into the realm of modern GCs.</p>

                                <p>D deserves to have a GC with few pauses and high multi-core performance. We hope to bring you that experience.</p>

                                <p>The D programming language and ecosystem provide many modern features which can help give developers a competitive advantage during the software development lifecycle. In this talk, I will discuss how D provides a competitive advantage for graphics application development (e.g., games, rendering), where any reduction in iteration time can improve outcomes. As an example, when creating an art style, having systems allowing rapid iteration can help improve visual fidelity, both in aesthetics and correctness of the application.</p>

                                <p>Throughout the talk I will showcase visual examples, developed in a summer, that show off a graphics engine built completely in the D ecosystem. Topics will include: a hot reload system, a job system (using concurrency), and showcasing the architecture of a small graphics engine. This talk follows up a previous Dconf Online 2024 talk in which I make a case for using D for graphics programming&mdash;this time showing you the results (attendees need not have watched the previous talk).</p>

                                <p>D-Scanner is one of the most widely used static code analysis tools for D. It relies on libdparse, a third-party D parser implementation. As a consequence, every time the D frontend is modified, both libdparse and D-Scanner need to be updated. Given that D can be built as a compiler library, replacing libdparse with DMD-as-a-library will make it easier to tackle compiler updates.</p>
                                
                                <p>Over the past year, I have embarked on a transformative journey within D-Scanner, tasked with migrating from libdparse to DMD-as-a-library. In this talk, we will explore the migration process and address the challenges of keeping up with DMD-as-a-library, integrating with upstream, and maintaining trustworthy tests.</p>

                <p>The DConf Hackathon has been part of every edition of DConf since 2017 in Berlin when Sebastian
                  Wilzbach suggested we extend the conference by one day to work on D projects. A number of
                  attendees worked on bugs, some tutored others on various D features, and one (Timon Gehr) used the
                  time to implement a new feature (<code>static foreach</code>).</p>
                <p>Use your time at the Hackathon the way you feel is best for you: submit PRs to the core D
                  repositories or your favorite projects in the broader ecosystem; hack on your own project, and
                  maybe enlist some help from a fellow attendee to work through a tough problem; tutor a novice D
                  programmer, or seek tutoring from someone more experienced; corner Walter or Átila and rant to
                  them about your biggest D pet peeve(s); or just sit and chat with the people around you.</p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is also open to the general public. If you are in the area on September 20th and
                  didn&#8217;t register for the conference, that&#8217;s okay. Join us anyway! If you registered, invite a
                  friend or relative, maybe someone who knows very little about our favorite programming
                  language&mdash;there are fewer times as opportune as this one to show them what it&#8217;s all
                  about.</p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is a great time to ramp up some work or wind down from three days of talks.
                  It&#8217;s your time, so use it as you will. See you there!</p>

                Our presentations will happen on the ground floor in the CTRL room, and we&#8217;ll have the entirety of the ESC area downstairs to ourselves, where attendees can relax, chat, or play table tennis or foosball between talks.

                There are several budget hotels in easy walking distance. The following are some options that, according to Google Maps, are less than a 20-minute walk from the venue. Some of them are near an underground station that is one stop away from Moorgate or Liverpool Street stations. Click a link to see the walking route(s) between a hotel and the venue. On the map, you&#8217;ll find links to reserve a room. Note that most attendees generally stay at the Travelodge London Central City Road.

            <h2 id="beerconf">BeerConf</h2>
            <p>Every evening during the first three nights of DConf means only one thing: BeerConf! <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">Ethan Watson coined the term in 2016</a> as a name for what happens at the designated evening gathering spot at every DConf. In 2019 and 2022, we were able to hire space at pubs for BeerConf. Unfortunately, last year and again this year, pub hire rates have been well beyond our budget.</p>
            <p>Even so, we&#8217;re fortunate this year in that an anonymous donor has sponsored one night of BeerConf at a pub! We&#8217;ll be at The Trinity Bell on Mitre Street, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/x1rq5owRGwQSPgLj7">roughly 15 minutes southeast of the venue on foot</a>. On the first night of the conference, September 17, drinks are on the house for all conference attendees from 18:00 until the tab runs out. When you get there, be sure to raise a glass in honor of our anonymous benefactor.</p>
            <p>We&#8217;re hoping to find more sponsors for the other two nights. In the event we&#8217;re unable to, we&#8217;ll designate a meetup spot. Unless and until we update this space with that information, the default location is the lobby bar of the Travelodge Central City Road.</p>

                DConf &#8217;24 is sponsored by <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">our friends at Symmetry Investments</a>. With offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey, and the Cayman Islands, Symmetry employs D in their investment management mission. This is the fourth time they&#8217;ve sponsored DConf, and we are thankful for their continued support. They are also the sponsors of the <a href="https://saoc.io/">Symmetry Autumn of Code</a>, an annual event that, since 2018, has provided experience to emerging programmers while enhancing the D ecosystem. We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to bring DConf to London once again with Symmetry&#8217;s support.
