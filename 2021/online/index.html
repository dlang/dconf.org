              <p>This talk is a brain dump from Átila on his view of the future of D. He believes that D needs to change, and that it's vital that backwards
              compatibility be maintained as much as possible. In the process, he outlines some of 
              the major issues D programmers face, shares some thoughts on what's stalling progress, and what some possible future changes could look 
              like (these possible changes are based on his personal opinions, and are not necessarily reflective of any current plans or strategy in his role as a co-maintainer of the
              language).</p>
              <p>On another level, this talk is a call to action for the D community. We have an awesome language that we all would love to be awesomer,
              but we need a group effort if we want to get there. In the meantime, there's a lot of material here for the post-talk Q & A session, and Átila is eager 
              to answer your questions!</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Átila Neves has a PhD in Particle Physics
              for research done at CERN. Most of the time spent there required
              programming in C++, with a two-year stint as a Perl programmer
              on the IT department's security team. He also worked for Cisco
              for almost seven years, developing networking software in C and
              C++ and leading his teams in the areas of software quality and
              testing. He now works as a D consultant/programmer for Symmetry
              Investments, as well as being the deputy maintainer of the D
              programming language. He spends his spare time yelling at the
              screen in frustration while waiting for computers to compile his
              code.</p>

              <p>The D programming language provides a number of compile-time traits, both 
              in the form of built-ins and a standard library API, that D users can employ 
              in reflecting over their code. But is there a better way?</p>

              <p>In this talk, Stefan will talk about his latest project, <code>core.reflect</code>, a package aimed at making reflection in D more efficient and more coherent by unifying the myriad compile-time traits we currently have in D. The talk will provide a basic overview of the package, describe Stefan's goals for the project, and explain what is currently blocking its completion.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Stefan has been programming in D
              personally and professionally since 2013. He has taken a special
              interest in the performance of D’s compile-time features and has
              been contibuting to DMD for over four years. He has presented
              either a full talk or a lightning talk at three real-world DConfs,
              and this is his second DConf Online talk.</p>

              <p>For those of us on systems not officially supported by the D Language
              Foundation (anything other than FreeBSD, Linux, MacOS, Windows), getting up and running with a D compiler on your platform of choice can be a little difficult. Which compiler do I choose? How do I port DRuntime? What about the unique features
              of my operating system? How do I get help with all this? How do I reduce my
              maintenance burden over time? Will anyone even care?</p>

              <p>The journey of D from pie-in-the-sky to a package officially offered
              in the OpenBSD package repository serves as a model story for other
              platforms who want to offer D to their userbase. We will walk through the
              many interconnected parts required to get a D package on OpenBSD, what the
              future is like for D outside the Big 4, how you can get started with D on
              your platform, and how those of us who enjoy life outside the Big 4 can be
              a positive force for D and the D community.</p>

              <p>D's large array of metaprogramming features can be quite overwhelming, so Bradley has picked out a few usage examples to spark a few ideas in beginning D programmers trying to find their way.</p>

              <p>This talk starts off with a brief overview of templates, then goes on to demonstrate progressively
              more advanced metaprogramming featurees. Topics covered include Compile Time Function Excecution (CTFE),
              User Defined Attributes (UDA), traits, static foreach, and more. At the end of the talk, Bradley
              highlights examples of real-world D projects that make heavy use of metaprogramming.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Bradley has been programming as a hobby since 2012. He choose D as his main language due to its expressiveness and amazing metaprogramming abilities. He has written several meta-heavy libraries and can't live without D's compile-time features. This is his first public talk.</p>

              <p>The D programming language is designed to have a zero-cost interface
                to C, but D still needs the corresponding C declarations to be written
                in D in order for the D compiler to access them. While this is very
                easy and straightforward, hand-translating 10,000+ lines of C header files
                gets very tedious very quickly. Mechanical translation of C headers to D
                has had only limited success.</p>
                
                <p>The ideal is for it to &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. The only solid way to get D code to
                import C declarations is for the D compiler to be able to compile C code directly.</p>
                
                <p>Walter has dismissed this approach as unworkable in the past. But the more he
                thought about, the more he realized he could make it work. After all, he's
                written a C99 compiler before. He knows how to do it. Piece of cake, right?
                
                Walter will talk about the journey of ImportC from inspiration to working implementation. And he would like to thank Iain Buclaw
                for his invaluable help with ImportC!</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all
              areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers,
              code generation, interpreter engines, and runtime libraries.
              Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.</p>

              <p>This talk covers the primitives used to represent glyphs, a bit
              of linear algebra, how to rasterize those glyphs, and then how to do it on
              the GPU.  No graphics knowledge necessary.  Code examples in D!</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card"> Elijah is a self-taught programmer who first discovered D 
              while looking for a better language than C++ for game development. Graphics
              programming is somethinghe's always found interesting (though he doesn't know it nearly well enough!) because of the somewhat rigid programming model it forces 
              upon you, and the performance you get as a result.</p>

              <p>GraphQL is a statically typed query language that is slowly supplanting REST. This talk will focus on D's server implementation.</p>

              <p>graphql-d is an implementation of a GraphQL server.
              The server receives a GraphQL query and eventually returns JSON.
              A lot has to happen in between: lexing, parsing, and validating the query is the easy part of this process. How to turn the validated query into JSON with graphql-d, a.k.a. the boring things, will be explained in this presentation.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Robert Schadek received a master's degree

              thesis was titled &ldquo;DMCD A Distributed Multithreading
              Caching D Compiler&rdquo; and introduced multi-threading, among
              other optimizations, to the compiler control flow. He was a
              computer science PhD student from 2012&ndash;2018 at the

              include some detail on how processors actually work, partly because it's
              relevant, but mostly because it's interesting.</p>

              <p>This talk will cover the basics of how to use a profiler and will go in deep on a small section of code and discuss why it performs the way it does. In the
              the course of the talk, Max will touch on performance-related topics, e.g, memory

              <p>DConf wouldn't be DConf, online or otherwise, without the &ldquo;Ask
              Us Anything!&rdquo; tradition, where the language maintainers step onto
              the stage to answer any and all questions from the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2IEvAdxjMdM">Last year's edition</a> ran just over an hour and covered
              a variety of topics. This year, we can run as long as we need to since it's the last
              event on the schedule. </p>
              
              <p>This year, we're breaking tradition a bit and bringing a third person into the
              mix. Razvan Nitu started working this year as the D Language Foundation's 
              Pull Request and Issue Manager. He has agreed to join in and take any questions 
              that come his way. And rumor has it that Walter will have a camera this time, so he won't be a disembodied voice like last time. Bring your best queries and show Razvan 
              just how much fun the DConf AUA can be!</p>

            <p>At every real-world DConf, a location near the venue is selected
            and anointed as the Official After-Hours Gathering Spot. After the
            last talk each evening, DConf attendees wander in and out, mingling,
            chatting, and just generally having a good time.

            href="https://dlang.org/blog/2017/04/19/the-dconf-experience/">Ethan
            Watson coined the term &ldquo;BeerConf&rdquo;</a> to refer to  the event and the name has stuck&mdash;so much so that he and other
            members of the D community <a
            href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/krtvrgubmqbnnrequmtq@forum.dlang.org">initiated
            an online BeerConf</a> after DConf 2020 was canceled due to the
            coronavirus pandemic. That one-off event was a hit, and it has been
            running once a month ever since.</p>
            <p>DConf Online is still DConf, so there still must be a BeerConf.
            And since it's online, we run it all weekend! The virtual
            BeerConf for the inaugural DConf Online edition was a lot of fun. We saw more
            simultaneous participants than in any prior online BeerConf session. The event 
            has been going strong once a month since then, and we are looking forward to a
            another great BeerConf experience during DConf Online 2021.</p>

         <p>Wait, did we say something about prizes for viewers? Yes! Speakers will be monitoring their talk videos for questions in the live chat. After each talk, the speaker will be available in the DConf Online 2021 livestream to answer further questions, elaborate on answers given during the talk, and discuss D and D development in general. Everyone who asks a question during a post-talk livestream will be eligible to win one or more prizes. A winner is selected at the end of each speaker's livestream session, another for the Daily Prize at the end of the livestream each day, and another for the weekend's Grand Prize at the end of the Day Two livestream.</p>

         <p>Last year, questioners were rewarded with several different items from the DLang Swag Emporium after the talks, $50.00 Amazon eGift cards for each day, and a $100 Amazon eGift card grand prize for the weekend.
