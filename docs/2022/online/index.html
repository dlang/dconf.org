        <h1>DConf Online Third Edition</h1>
        <p>
            The D Language Foundation invites you to join us for the third edition of DConf Online, December 17th and 18th, 2022! It&#8217;s all happening on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDLanguageFoundation">the D Language Foundation&#8217;s YouTube channel</a>, and it&#8217;s completely free. No registration required. All you need is a web browser or YouTube app, an internet connection, and, if you want to participate in the live chats, a YouTube account.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with past editions of DConf Online, you&#8217;ll be able to watch a number of prerecorded talks as they appear, and ask questions of each speaker during the talks, and in an ongoing livestream after the talks. All of the talks and the livestreams from both days will continue to be available after the conference ends, and we&#8217;ll upload each post-talk Q & A session as separate, trimmed-down videos. You can watch videos from the past editions at the following links.

        </ul>
        <p>
            When we had to cancel DConf in 2020 due to the pandemic, we launched the online version as a companion to, and not a substitute for, the real-world version. <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/">DConf &#8216;22 was arguably the best DConf yet</a>, and now we finally get to have both versions in the same year. We look forward to continuing both in the years to come.

    <div class="w3-container w3-margin-top" id="schedule">
      <article class="w3-content">
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>Both days of DConf Online &#8216;22 start with a livestream at 13:50 UTC hosted by Mike Parker. Here are the links:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/DAIskYu9Imo">DConf Online &#8216;22 Day One Q &amp; A Livestream</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/VCgdajZconA">DConf Online &#8216;22 Day Two Q &amp; A Livestream</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of the talks are pre-recorded videos which are set to premiere at the scheduled times below.</p>
        <h3>The Livestream</h3>
        <p>Each presenter will join the livestream five minutes prior to the start of their talk. During the talk, the presenter will remain in the livestream. They will answer questions both from the talk video&#8217;s livechat and from the livestream. They&#8217;ll answer livechat questions in two ways: they&#8217;ll type short answers in the livechat, and they&#8217;ll verbalize each answer in the livestream, elaborating as required. In between questions, Mike will chat with the presenter, asking his own questions about their talk and their experience with the D language. After the talk ends, the presenter will remain in the livestream for another 20 minutes or so for a Q &amp; A session. During this post-talk session, anyone whose question is answered will be entered into a drawing for a prize.</p>
        <p>Viewers are free to remain in the livestream during each talk, but we recommend you instead do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pull up the livestream five minutes prior to each talk for the pre-talk session.</li>
          <li>Leave the livestream to watch the talk when it premieres (a link to the talk will be posted in the livestream chat during the pre-talk session).</li>
          <li>Pull up the livestream again for the post-talk Q &amp; A session (each talk will redirect to the livestream when it ends).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why do we do it this way? Each presenter should be available anyway to answer questions in their talk&#8217;s livechat, but a chat box isn&#8217;t the best medium for long, detailed answers and followups. The livestream gives them the opportunity to provide more detailed answers, often with followups from the host, and allows us to record all such answers for posterity. Each presenter&#8217;s livestream session will be recorded, edited, and uploaded to our YouTube channel as an independent video. Watch the livestream Q &amp; A sessions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIldXzSkPUXX0PcnTlv175rEyfH66yaoI">DConf Online 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIldXzSkPUXVSD9mrF1rHk2G-6AzdddPk">DConf Online 2021</a> as examples of what to expect.</p>

                  <p class="talkdesc">The calculation of gradients is a way to understand the universe. For the entire history of computing, people have been writing programs that calculate them. For many years these were written arduously (and often incorrectly) by hand, or in specialist languages dealing only in mathematics. Via the use of a set of techniques known as automatic differentiation, we can write programs which not only calculate gradients <em>exactly</em> but also without writing them manually&mdash;differentiable programming. I will summarise where the mathematics comes from, then walk through some simple code to implement both modes of automatic differentiation and apply them to some simple problems. Also included is a little historical discussion of some past techniques for specifying systems of derivatives to model systems, but which are not considered differentiable programming.</p>

                  <p class="talkdesc">This is a crash course on translating C code to D code, from small code snippets on stack overflow to entire C libraries.
                    Since D has similar syntax and features to C, this is relatively easy, but there are some pitfalls, and it still requires tedious text editing.
                    I'm going to present key differences you should be aware of and present the 'ctod' tool I made that does most of the tedious work for you.</p>

                  <p class="talkdesc">Syntactic sugar can be a mystery. You know how pointers and values work, but how does that relate to syntactic sugar? The specification says what
                    the sugar is supposed to do but not how it works. Knowing how it's implemented is key to making informed tradeoffs about when to make
                    use of sugar. Personally, I am uncomfortable with using a programming language without knowing what is going on under the hood. After all, a race car driver
                    that knows how his car works is going to get more out of it than a driver that only knows that stepping on the gas makes it go faster. I never understood
                    virtual functions in C++ until I examined the output of Bjarne's C++ to C translator.</p>

                <p>This talk is about the modelling power of D, and why you should at least
                  consider using structs or classes as models for your APIs. As D has features
                  such as introspection and generative programming, building a model can be just
                  as effective as using code to form your API. Plus a model can be a whole lot
                  prettier in the end. Slap on some UDA magic and the code almost writes itself!</p>
                <p>
                  As I talked about in my 2019 talk on serialization, we want to use the D
                  compiler to the best of its abilities. We&#8217;ll look at a few cases where modelling
                  can shine as a way to express how your program should behave and look
                  intuitive to those reading the code.
