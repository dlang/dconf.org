        <h1>DConf Returns to London</h1>
        <p>
          Thanks to our friends at Symmetry Investments, the D Programming Language Conference took place in London from <strong>August 1&ndash;4, 2022</strong>. This was Symmetry's second time hosting the conference in London for us, and it was even better than the first time! Everyone at the D Language Foundation is grateful for the time, money, and effort they put toward hosting a successful event.
        </p>
        <p>
          DConf is the largest meetup event of the D programming language community. Like many other annual gatherings throughout the world, we were sidelined for two years by events beyond our control. We'd had regular meetups online to tide us over, but we were eager to once again meet face-to-face in the real world. Our anticipation was well satisfied as old hands and new, including several first-time DConf speakers, joined us for four days of education, knowledge sharing, fellowship, and fun.
        </p>
        <p id="lslinks">
          All of the talks are freely viewable via recordings of the livestreams from each day at the following links:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/V6KFtzF2Hx8">Day 1 Livestream</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/04gJXpJ1i8M">Day 2 Livestream</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/ksNGwLTe0Ps">Day 3 Livestream</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We're in the process of preparing individual videos of each talk. Those will be available on our YouTube channel, a link to which you'll in the talk details for each talk in the schedule below. Slide links are available for each talk now.

                  <p>Any complex system will exhibit some unexpected emergent properties. Some can be quite delightful, like the glorious combination of strawberries and cream. Here are some discoveries that make programs nicer, faster, more readable, and just more fun. We'll show how to customize literals, stack allocate instead of memory allocate, avoid memory allocation entirely, define errors out of existence, unsnarl the code, have fancy initializers, make your own scoped types, and a very special discovery.</p>

                <p class="bio w3-card">Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation, interpreter engines, and runtime libraries.

                <p>D 2.0 added a new const system to the language. But half of that system&mdash;immutable&mdash;still often leads to errors. That's a shame, as immutable data structures enable more reliable, readable, and testable code. However, with some limited compiler abuse, immutable can generally be made to function. Here's how.</p>

                  <p>Different hardware architectures implement different memory models. This in turn makes porting software between different targets an insanely complicated task. To solve this problem, C++11 introduced a language memory model that was later adopted by other languages such as D and Rust. In this talk, we will discuss the problem, the solution, and why you still have to be careful if you want to maximize performance. In addition, we will consider ways to try and make atomic variables easier to reason about.</p>

                  <p>Structured concurrency applies the lessons of structured programming to concurrency with the aim of reducing software cost and complexity. This talk starts from the basics and builds up to the concept of structured asynchronous computation as implemented by C++&#8217;s Sender/Receivers. This can be used to build up larger patterns including event loops, asynchronous ranges, actor models, etc., and provides a flexible and composable way to write concurrent and parallel programs without the need for explicit synchronization or understanding complex topics like memory ordering.</p>

Being aware of the inherit complexities of multithreaded systems has led him to recognize the importance of structured concurrency and its ability to improve local reasoning of code.</p>

                <p>Peter Shirley&#8217;s book &#8216;Ray Tracing in One Weekend&#8217; has been a brilliant introduction to implementing ray tracers for beginners. While you may not have read the book, you may have seen the  viral images of programmers all over the world sharing images generated from their ray tracers on social media. While the book is implemented in C++, I was up for the challenge to implement the ray tracer in D. With the efficiency of the D language however, I set myself the challenge to complete the task in less than 24 hours. In this talk I will describe my experience, highlighting features of the D  language that made this possible. I will also discuss why D may be the right language to teach software  engineering in a university setting for this reason.</p>

                  <p>&#8220;A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.&#8221; D is multi-paradigm, which is sometimes considered a weakness: the language is spread thin, and making every feature work with every other feature is a complex task. Despite this, I consider it one of D&#8217;s strengths that low-level and high-level come together in one language. I&#8217;ll talk about how I use D in various projects of my own, from bare metal to high-level scripts, and why D is a suitable language for them despite their different nature.</p>

                  <p>GNU Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that enables a wide range of use cases, from custom Domain-Specific Languages to parsers used inside programming language compilers and interpreters. This talk aims to present the D backend for GNU Bison to a wider audience&mdash;it was officially introduced in Bison in the autumn of 2021, but this has not yet  reached the wider D community. I will delve into how I continued GNU Bison&#8217;s experimental D parser, which was implementing the LALR(1) algorithm. I will present how I designed the API for D, how I implemented some key features, and the challenges I faced. If you are curious about how I interacted with the Bison project and my experience with SAoC, then this talk is for you!

                  <p>D adoption has been hindered by the scarcity of development tools available in the ecosystem. One of the main reasons for this situation has been the absence of a proper compiler library that can be leveraged to develop tools. For a few years, a compiler library has exposed the DMD internals, but the interface is still lacking. To address this problem, I am taking a different approach by trying to integrate the DMD library into existing, successful projects. This project has two objectives: (1) developing a proper interface for the  compiler library by leveraging existing use cases, and (2) updating existing tools to use the compiler library, thereby making it easier to update to the latest version of the compiler.</p>

                  <p>Lightning Talks are a set of presentations restricted to five minutes or less. Speakers plug in their laptops and get started immediately. When their time is up, the emcee pulls them off stage and the next speaker gets going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TkNep5zHWNw">The Lightning Talk session from DConf 2019</a> is a great example of the format.</p>

                  <p>In D, certain high-level constructs are lowered to calls to functions from DRuntime called hooks. This process takes place in the compiler&#8217;s intermediate representation generator. This has the following disadvantages:</p>
                  <ol class="wr-ol">
                    <li>The compiler doesn't verify the safety of the hooks, because lowerings take place after semantic analysis. This means that the hooks are essentially lying about their attributes.</li>
                    <li>The hook arguments are mostly <code>void[]</code> and require the <code>TypeInfo</code> hierarchy to extract type information at runtime. This is unnecessarily slow because all type information is available at compile time.</li>
                    <li>All hooks are linked into one large runtime library that all D programs link, regardless of which hooks they use. This makes druntime unnecessarily large for use cases where a subset of the hooks is used.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>This project eliminates all these disadvantages by converting all DRuntime hooks to templates and moving the lowering logic to the semantic phase. Thus, all new hooks are verified to respect the restrictions imposed by attributes, type information is leveraged at compile time, and D executables will only contain code for the hooks they use. In addition, this brings performance benefits since runtime checks are moved to compile time.

                  <p>D&#8217;s perfection does not come from the language, but its standard library. The necessary migration from D&#8217;s self hosted Bugzilla to GitHub serves as a rewarding backdrop to explore this marvelous library.</p>
                  <p>Phobos is not always given the credit it deserves. Loud negative talk about its reliance on the GC or interconnectedness of its modules are nothing more than distractions from its expressiveness and comprehensiveness. The task of migrating all open Bugzilla issues to GitHub gives a very good opportunity to explore many Phobos modules and their interplay. This task requires everything from networking, to text processing and data aggregation. Many of those exercises are likely reflective of others&#8217; daily work, and thus they would likely gain an understanding of Phobos if they are not already using it.</p>

                  <p>Walter Bright started the D programming language as a one-man show. After he pushed it out to the wider world, curious programmers started dropping by to check it out. Little by little, person by person, a community took form. They brought new ideas, bug reports, and patches. They built libraries and tools, wrote blog articles, and evangelized the language in other communities. Without those early pioneers, D as we know it would not exist today.</p>
                  <p>In this talk, we&#8217;ll journey back in time to get a look at where it all started, then move forward to the present day, stopping for highlights along the way. My goal is to show you why I&#8217;m an eternal optimist about D&mdash;no matter the state in which you first found the language, it&#8217;s always better than it used to be thanks to the efforts of the amazing D community. We&#8217;ll wrap things up with a look at how I would like to see the community and the ecosystem evolve in the future.</p>

                <p>The DConf Hackathon has been part of every edition of DConf since 2017 in Berlin, when Sebastian Wilzbach suggested we extend the conference by one day to work on D projects. A number of attendees worked on bugs, some tutored others on various D features, and one (Timon Gehr) used the time to implement a new feature (<code>static foreach</code>).</p>
                <p>Use your time at the Hackathon the way you feel is best for you: submit PRs to the core D repositories or your favorite projects in the broader ecosystem; hack on your own project, and maybe enlist some help from a fellow attendee to work through a tough problem; tutor a novice D programmer, or seek tutoring from someone more experienced; corner Walter or √Åtila and rant to them about your biggest D pet peeve(s); or just sit and chat with the people around you.</p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is also open to the general public. If you are in the area on August 4th and didn't register for the conference, that&#8217;s okay. Join us anyway! If you registered, invite a friend or relative, maybe someone who knows very little about our favorite programming language&mdash;there are fewer times as opportune as this one to show them what it&#8217;s all about.</p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is a great time to ramp up some work or wind down from three days of talks. It&#8217;s your time, so use it as you will. See you there!</p>

          Traditionally, on each of the first three evenings we designate a location where attendees can gather to hang out and chat over drinks. Often, it&#8217;s a the lobby or bar of a nearby hotel. When we are unable to find a hotel with a suitable space, we look for a pub that has space for hire. Ethan Watson coined the term BeerConf, and it stuck. Since 2020, when DConf was canceled due to the pandemic, we&#8217;ve also been holding an online BeerConf on the last weekend of every month. You can <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">read more about it on the D Wiki</a>.

        <p>DConf &#8217;22 is hosted by <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">our friends at Symmetry Investments</a>. With offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey, and the Cayman Islands, Symmetry employs D in their investment
          management mission. This is the second time they've hosted a DConf. Their first go in 2019 was a smashing success. They are also the sponsors of the
          <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/">Symmetry Autumn of Code</a>, an annual event that, since 2018, has provided experience to emerging programmers while
          enhancing the D ecosystem. We couldn't be more thrilled to be working with Symmetry in bringing DConf to London once again.</p>
