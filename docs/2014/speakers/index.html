After twenty years of developing software he returned in 2001 to his first professional love, teaching. He is a professor and chair of computer science at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. He has published over 100 articles and in his spare time gives training on C++, Python, D and software development principles.

Being a professional in the gaming industry for 6 years I worked for titles like "The Settlers - Rise of Cultures" for PC and "Endwar" for PSP/NDS. During the last 3 years and due to the shifting in this sector from boxed to online games I mainly focused on developing server backends for massive online titles including "Cultures Online" and most recently "Panzer General Online". D is on my radar at least since 2007 (I submitted the first dmd bug back then), in 2009 I wrote my B.Sc Thesis about "D in game development" and now I finally convinced my boss to switch from Node.js to D in production. The D sphere knows me best as
"Extrawurst", my contributions to TDPL, for my article series about this talk’s topic, the various libraries I open sourced for developing a mobile game server backend in D and my engagement to bring German speaking D developers together in the #d.de channel as an operator.</td>

I have a PhD in Particle Physics for research done at CERN. Most of the research itself required programming in C++, and I also had a major participation in the coding of the experiment’s data acquisition and decoding software in C and C++. I later joined the Computer Security Team at CERN in the IT department and spent two years there writing Perl.

<p>I currently work at Cisco writing networking software, my job having re- quired me to write in C, C++, Perl, Python, Java and Ruby. I even wrote a small D wrapper for our C API for fun.</p>

<p>The software I wrote and will cover in the talk stems from the work done at my job at Cisco. Both software libraries were written as a better alternative inspired by the code used at work for writing unit tests and serialising network protocol packets. I first wrote them in C++ and after learning D soon realised that both of them would work better in D due to D’s unique capabilities.</p>

<p>The result of this work was a comparison of MQTT broker implementations in different languages, D being one of them, that ended up generating a lot of discussion on Hacker News and programming subreddit.</p></td>

I first became aware of D in 2005 when Steve Yeggie included it in a survey of programing languages blog post he wrote while the two of us were at Amazon.  A year or so later I wanted to learn more and was appalled at the lack of infrastructure I expected to find in a project of it's scale.  Newsgroups only, no bug tracking, no source control system (no, occasional tarballs doesn't count, Walter), incomplete source, no public tests, etc.  So, I set out to make all of these things exist/happen.

<p>Outside the realm of D, I've been writing software professionally for the last 25 years, primarily in data processing and back-end systems. Lots of networking, telecom, database, and distributed systems work for IBM, Informix, Netscape, and Amazon to list the ones anyone would recognize.  Additional, at each of those companies, I've tended to also invest considerable time in supporting the software management systems.</p></td>
