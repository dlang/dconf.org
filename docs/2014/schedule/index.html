      Jonathan Crapuchettes<span class="abstract"><I >An industry success story:</I> EMSI needed to improve its data
processes with n-­dimensional dataset processing, in-­memory data manipulation,
data type checking, internal testing, and code correctness. D was the language
of choice because it couples low-­level performance with high-­level design.

<p>EMSI began manipulating economic labor market data using Excel. The company next used SQL for computations, while Excel spreadsheets handled the flow of the operations. As more data sets were incorporated and increasingly complex methodology was added, we moved the flow control to PHP because of its “ease” of development and widespread use. One of the goals when moving to PHP was to allow for quarterly runs of the data processing with just the push of a button. Sadly this goal never came to fruition, but during this time some fundamental concepts regarding data storage structure took shape.</p>

<p>Within a few years the PHP code base had become unwieldy and lacked the kind of internal error­checking that we desperately needed. It was also missing the capacity to manipulate datasets of arbitrary dimensions: up to that point datasets had been two­dimensional (e.g., Area by Industry or Area by Occupation), but demographic measures­­which were becoming increasingly in demand­­added at least two additional dimensions to each dataset. We decided that a new library of dataset structures and manipulation functions needed to be created.</p>

<p>After much debate, D was selected as the language for the new framework. We have been using D since 2007 for some performance-­oriented utilities and appreciated its productive inclusiveness of features from inline assembly to associative arrays in the same clean language. We determined that
D’s fast compile times, strong static typing, and powerful templating capabilities were ideal for building strongly­-checked and performant data processes. Equally important, D’s high­level features made it accessible to data developers with a wide­range of programming skill and experience.
</p>

<p>Most importantly, choosing D allowed for the development of five major constructs which today form the basis for our data processing framework: cubes, data storage engines, dimensions, hierarchies, and measures. Cubes encompass data storage engines and offer abstraction layers for particular sets of functionality. Data storage engines hold the dimensions and data nodes for each cube. Dimensions are compile­time concepts that have templated names and hierarchy node types. Hierarchies handle the run­time concepts of classification codes and their levels (e.g., counties to states and states to the nation). Finally, measures are the data contained within each node in the cubes.
</p>

<p>In applying these constructs, we make heavy use of templated structs, classes, and functions to build custom algorithms at compile­time that are optimized for specific use cases and allow for quicker realization of errors. All in all, D provided a faster, cleaner development of data processes and enabled us to build a framework that met our specific needs while giving us a platform from which we can further develop and improve our processes into the future.
</p>

<p>I will also be showing examples from our code base of techniques that we have used as well as discussing some of the problems we encountered with D during development.

Higgs, a JIT compiler for JavaScript written in D, was presented at DConf 2013.
Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of
testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring
how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of
benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results
to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler
architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining.
We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more
in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in
the Higgs implementation.</span>

Microcontrollers (MCUs) offer a unique and challenging set of constraints for any programming language. They are not fast (10's to low 100's of MHz), they have very little storage (100's of KB) and have even less RAM. Due to these extremely limited resources, languages used to program these tiny, ubiquitous machines must generate the most efficient code in terms of both size and speed. This talk will show that D can program microcontrollers just as well, if not better than the current de facto languages, and will detail progress on the recently launched effort bring D to the ARM Cortex-M family of MCUs.</span>

Memory safety, powerful abstractions, and fast compilation are great features
to have. But what about high performance code? This talk shows how D can deliver
on generating highly competitive, no-compromise performance applications.
Conventional wisdom says that high performance and powerful abstractions are
in conflict with each other, that one must write close-to-the-metal code to get
high performance. Bright will show that this is no longer true with a modern
high level language like D.</span>

      Don Clugston<span class="abstract">
"Big Data" applications, which process petabytes of data per year, are
computationally demanding, yet they have different requirements from
traditional performance-critical applications. A programming language which
is well suited for CPU-bound code, isn't necessarily ideal for real-time Big
Data.

<p>At Sociomantic Labs, we consume a deluge of real time data every day using
an all-D technology stack. This talk will explain how our use of D has been
successful in our intensely competitive industry.
Unfortunately, most existing D libraries were not designed for Big Data
applications. I'll discuss the performance killers they contain,
and propose some changes to make D the natural choice for Big Data tasks.</p></span>

      Adam Ruppe<span class="abstract">
"kernel in D" is a fairly common topic on forums. I've
written a minimal runtime and then rebuilt it back up to the point
where we can produce a ~30 KB stand-alone executable which can be used
on Linux or on bare metal with the support of a decently large subset
of the language (classes, exceptions, even closures with some manual
care). By creatively hacking the RTInfo facility in <tt>object.d</tt>, we can
also perform some static checks on defined types to help confirm to
performance or correctness checks.

<p>For example, storing a slice without the GC is prone to losing track
of who owns the memory. Using RTInfo and compile time reflection, we
can scan all user types and issue a compile error any time this is
done, directing the user to use an owned array struct instead.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that such techniques may be usable in the full
druntime as well, without stepping on other uses, e.g. precise GC.</p></span>

When term "declarative programming" is used in context of imperative languages,
it is most often associated with Domain-Specific Languages. However, it is a
more general approach with essential value of separating meaningful description

a revelation for any experienced D users.
