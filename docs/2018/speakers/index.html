<p>Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation, interpreter engines and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.</p></td>

<p>Andrei Alexandrescu coined the colloquial term "modern C++" (adapted from his award-winning book Modern C++ Design), used today to describe a collection of important C++ styles and idioms. He is also the coauthor (with Herb Sutter) of C++ Coding Standards and the author of The D Programming Language book. With Walter Bright, Andrei co-designed many important features of D and authored a large part of D's standard library. His research on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing completes a broad spectrum of expertise. Andrei holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University "Politehnica" Bucharest. He works with the D Language Foundation.

<p>Martin Odersky is the inventor of the Scala language, a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and a founder of Lightbend. His work concentrates on the fusion of functional and object-oriented programming. He believes the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as possible. To prove this, he has worked on a number of language designs, from Pizza to GJ to Functional Nets. He was named an ACM fellow for his achievements in this area. He has also influenced the development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the original author of the current javac reference compiler.

<p>Johan Engelen is one of the core LDC developers. He is also a D compiler consultant for Weka.io (probably the largest industrial single-executable D codebase) and maintains and adds features to their fork of LDC. While working on LDC, he often studies the compiler output IR and assembly. To aid this, he helped setting up LDC at d.godbolt.org. Examples of his recent contributions to LDC related to LLVM functionality are: fuzzing with libFuzzer, better AddressSanitizer support, and IR-based PGO. Johan (PhD Electrical Engineering) is assistant professor in the Robotics and Mechatronics (RAM) group at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. His software engineering skills stem largely from participating in open source communities such as Inkscape, LLVM, Dlang, and LDC.

<p>Dr. Vang Le focused on physics during his high-school years, but spent his university career in molecular biology. Computer science and programming were always a secret hobby. He got a Postdoc job in Denmark which required both molecular biology and computer science. This gave birth to a full-time bioinformatician job where he openly combine his passions for computer science and curiosity for living things. He currently works in Aalborg University Hospital as a clinical bioinformatician, where he is key in establishing bioinformatic infrastructure and routine analysis workflows to deal with the great amount of data from next generation sequencing (NGS) machines. He has great opportunities to set up computer clusters for storage and computation and to learn many cutting edge technologies. He sees D as a great alternative to C and C++ and predicts it will one day enjoy a level of popularity (particularly in bioinformatics) comparable to C, C++, Java, or Python.
