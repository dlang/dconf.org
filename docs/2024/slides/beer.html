<h1 class="title">Using Dustmite to Make Good Testcases</h1>
</header>
<h1 id="effective-dustmite">Effective Dustmite</h1>
<p>Dustmite is a tool written by CyberShadow that ships with the stock
DMD download. It is a bug reducer.</p>
<p>Have you ever run into a compiler bug? Or some error message that you
didn’t understand, because it involved too much source code? Have you
formed a theory about what was its cause, only for your simple testcase
to end up unable to reproduce it? How does everybody else make those
nice, simple testcases anyways? The answer is Dustmite.</p>
<p>How does that work? In fully general terms, Dustmite takes two
things: a test folder, and a tester. The tester <em>demonstrates the
presence</em> of the bug. In other words, the tester is some form of
executable, a D file, a Bash script, a bat file, that is executed in the
test folder and succeeds if and only if the bug is present.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-i-do-this">How do I do this?</h1>
<p>Let’s step through a basic reduction. This is the workflow I use,
born from experience:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a new folder for the repro.</li>
<li>Copy your project to <code>./src1/</code> in the repro folder.</li>
<li>Create your repro script in <code>repro1.sh</code>. Note that this
should run <em>from</em> <code>./src1/</code>, but it should be
<em>placed</em> in the repro folder itself. Remember to make it
executable with <code>chmod +x</code>!</li>
<li>Run dustmite: <code>dustmite src1 ../repro1.sh</code>. This will
create <code>src1.reduced</code>.</li>
<li>Don’t even look at that folder! <strong>First,</strong> copy the
output folder to <code>src2</code> and the repro script to
<code>repro2.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Look at the source and decide what follow-up steps to take.</li>
<li>Repeat 4-7 until your output is sufficiently minimal.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you end up with this structure:</p>
<pre><code>/test
/test/src1/
/test/src1.reduced/
/test/repro1.sh
/test/src2/
/test/src2.reduced/
/test/repro2.sh
/test/src3/
/test/repro3.sh</code></pre>
<p>Why all the copying? It is <em>very</em> easy to look at the output
and go “oh, I understand the issue now, I’ll simplify it a bit more and
then file the bug.” It’s often not what you think! The
<code>src.reduced</code> folder is the product of <strong>hours</strong>
of compute. Keep it pristine. If you mess up your <code>src2</code>, you
can just delete it and restart from <code>src1.reduced</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it. However, the devil is in the details.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-dustmite-actually-work">How does Dustmite actually
work?</h1>
<p>To understand the following sections, it’s important to have a good
model for the actual thing that Dustmite does.</p>
<p>Dustmite internally:</p>
<ul>
<li>reads in the <em>complete</em> source folder.</li>
<li>validates the repro script: it should succeed (that is, demonstrate
the error) with the repro, but fail with an empty folder.</li>
<li>In a loop:
<ul>
<li>performs a reduction operation, which is usually deleting a piece of
the parse tree, ie. removing a function call, emptying a string,
removing an empty loop, or even removing a whole file or function</li>
<li>writes out the modified source, then tests if the error still exists
(the repro script still passes)</li>
<li>if yes, records the modified output as a success; if not, as a
failure.</li>
<li>continues while it can remove parts of source code and the repro
script keeps generating successes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When it can find no more reductions, it exits.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="writing-a-good-repro-script">Writing a good repro script</h1>
<p>In other tools, you may have different workflows for debugging a
compiler crash, an application crash, or a miscompilation. Dustmite
doesn’t care. The tester may use <em>any means</em> to ascertain the
presence of the bug. In technical terms, Dustmite looks at the exit
status of the tester. This can mess you up: if you are testing for a
compiler crash, you have to <em>invert</em> the exit status:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
dmd test.d
# segfault
[ $? = 139 ]</code></pre>
<p>Or to test the produced binary:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
dmd test.d -oftest
./test
[ $? = 139 ]</code></pre>
<p>However, this is still not a very good repro. Why?</p>
<p>As a rule, we want to test for as much <em>relevant</em> details as
possible while excluding as many <em>irrelevant</em> details as we can.
For instance, when debugging a segfault, it is common for Dustmite to
replace one segfault with another, totally unrelated segfault. It turns
out that when removing code, it’s easy to arrive at code that segfaults.
:)</p>
<p>When at all possible, you should replace a generic segfault with
something like an assertion at a specific line. Debug the segfault,
replace it with a null check that asserts out, then:</p>
<pre><code>(./program &amp;&amp; exit) 2&gt;&amp;1 |grep &#39;Error Message Goes Here&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, you can test for DMD error messages in the same way.</p>
<p>However, how do you avoid Dustmite optimizing out the assignment of
the field that becomes null, then? One easy trick is to hide the error
message in a file that is outside your source folder, then compile it in
with <code>dmd ../error1.d</code>. In fact, this is exactly why we keep
the tester outside the source folder: otherwise, Dustmite would
correctly notice that the easiest way to make the tester pass is to
delete all lines of code inside it!</p>
<p>In other words, you can always protect a piece of code or script from
being reduced by putting it outside the source folder. Also, you can
pull source into the source folder to trace it.</p>
<h2 id="important-safety-warning">Important Safety Warning</h2>
<p>D reductions can end up with infinite loops and unlimited memory
leaks! Gauge the RAM your compilation takes, then set memory and CPU
limits in your repro script:</p>
<pre><code># limit DMD to 10 seconds
ulimit -t 10
# limit DMD to 4 GB
ulimit -v $((4096*1024))</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>timeout</code> under Windows, but I’m afraid there
is no simple equivalent for the memory limit.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-source-folder-ready-for-the-initial-run">Getting the
source folder ready for the initial run</h1>
<p>So how do you go about things? First of all, whatever build tool you
use, dub, jinja, reggae, you <em>can</em> keep using it, but usually you
want to get down to a DMD command line. This puts the minimal distance
between you and the actual run, and lets you easily inspect the exit
code and error.</p>
<p>As the second step, you should clean up all built binaries in your
source folder. Dustmite <em>can</em> do this for you, by noticing they
don’t affect the error, but it’s awkward because it has to load the
whole binary into memory. Also if you start with only source code, you
don’t have to worry that you’re accidentally testing the wrong
binary.</p>
<p>Note that the source code being reduced does not have to be D, or any
known programming language at all. Dustmite will try to parse all files
in its directory as D, but it has other strategies: for instance, you
can configure it to split files by line:</p>
<pre><code>dustmite --split *.csv:lines</code></pre>
<p>And it will try to remove lines from CSV files.</p>
<h1 id="first-run">First run</h1>
<p>So now you have a source folder <code>src1</code>, you manually run
your repro script and it exits with success. It’s time to start your
first dustmite run:</p>
<pre><code>$ dustmite src1 ../repro1.sh</code></pre>
<p>Now dustmite will tell you if your repro script has an issue, but if
everything is well it will begin its run.</p>
<p>At this point, I recommend going home for the weekend. :-) DMD is not
the fastest compiler (depends on source), and Dustmite will now
potentially kick off tens of thousands of DMD runs. When you come back,
you should have a new directory: <code>src1.reduced</code>, containing
the minimal source code that still passes the test.</p>
<p>At this point, again, immediately copy this folder to
<code>src2</code>. It represents the outcome of potentially multiple
days of compute time, and must be protected. In <code>src2</code>, you
can look around and edit as much as you want.</p>
<h1 id="what-now">What now?</h1>
<p>If you’re lucky, you will be done. However, this is unlikely, because
there are many patterns that Dustmite cannot reduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>mutual dependencies (<code>foo(a) -&gt; bar(a) -&gt; foo(a)</code>,
where <code>a</code> is not necessary)</li>
<li>type changes (<code>template!T</code> to
<code>template!int</code>)</li>
<li>and generally any sort of changes that require understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the first thing you should do is rerun your repro command
and double-check that you’ve ended up with the <em>same</em> bug as you
started out with. It’s possible to look at the source code and go “oh
duh, of course this crashes now.” This is usually because Dustmite
removed some code that turned an incidental crash into an obvious crash,
for instance removing a variable assignment to a pointer. In that case,
you’ve sadly wasted your time, and have to go back and find a better
setup for your initial source and repro script.</p>
<p>Assuming your reproduction is good, but you want to reduce it
further, there are several strategies that can be used:</p>
<h2 id="inlining-libraries-or-phobos-modules">Inlining libraries or
Phobos modules</h2>
<p>Often at this point you find that most of the problem is in a Dub or
Phobos library. The easiest way to handle this is to just copy the
entire library into your project.</p>
<p>The dub sources are at
<code>$HOME/.dub/packages/{name}/{version}/{repo}</code>. The Phobos
sources are at <code>{DMDDIR}/src/</code> in your install folder, or
<code>/usr/lib/ldc/x86_64-linux-gnu/include/d</code> for Ubuntu LDC.</p>
<p>Now, copy the module in question into your project, and immediately
change the name to something else! This is important, because it means
that Dustmite can’t just remove the entire file and go back to importing
the existing file. Make sure it still runs, by deleting everything that
doesn’t - this usually isn’t much. Change <code>package</code> to
<code>public</code> where required. Mass-replace all your imports and
references over to the new name. Then just rerun Dustmite with the new
folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ dustmite src2 ../repro2.sh</code></pre>
<h2 id="specializing-templates">Specializing templates</h2>
<p>Often issues hide inside templates that are instantiated with
multiple different types in your remaining source, split into different
<code>static if</code>s or different code paths. This can make it hard
to see what the actual necessary code is.</p>
<p>For instance, if you descended into <code>std.typecons</code>, you
may now have <code>Nullable!int</code> and <code>Nullable!string</code>
remaining in your repro code.</p>
<p>You can break this template open by simply making two copies:</p>
<pre><code>struct Nullable_int(T) { ... }
struct Nullable_string(T) { ... }</code></pre>
<p>And referencing each separately. This will allow Dustmite to strip
out the parts that the <code>int</code> version doesn’t need, and the
parts that the <code>string</code> version doesn’t need, making each
case easier to follow.</p>
<p>You can also try replacing all uses of <code>T</code> in each with
<code>int</code> or <code>string</code> directly, though that may not
work.</p>
<h2 id="wild-flailing">Wild flailing</h2>
<p>Honestly, at this stage your code is probably small enough that you
can just file a bug directly. However, if you want to have some fun,
form a theory about what the issue is and try it out: for instance,
replace type parameters with <code>int</code>, or parameters with
<code>0</code> and see if it still breaks.</p>
<p>Often, the final reproduction is <em>distressingly</em> simple. From
a user level, it’s common to think of bugs in terms of a domain problem,
but from the perspective of the compiler it’s usually something like
“three particular features were used in an order that nobody has tried
before”. Even staring directly at the final reduction, it can be hard to
understand what the actual problem even is.</p>
<p>Remember that if you went the wrong way in your reduction, you can
always go back to a previous state.</p>
<p>If your final repro contains
<code>__traits(compiles, &lt;expr&gt;)</code>, take a drink. You’ve
joined the club of speculative semantic pass bugs. About half my bugs
contain this line.</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to CyberShadow for his excellent tool.</p>
<p>That’s it. Have fun!</p>
