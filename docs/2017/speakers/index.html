<p>I am a generalist programmer, with a good grasp of computer architecture and distributed systems. I started using D early in its life, but I became especially interested in the language when ranges and range-based algorithms were introduced. These STL-inspired facilities made significant progress on a promise that object-oriented programming failed to deliver, and which the STL only delivered to a limited extent: the design and employment of reusable components.</p>

<p>By training I am a software engineer. By night I wear a cape and dabble in hardware design. A few years ago I bought an FPGA and taught myself hardware design. While FPGAs are super exciting, I found that VHDL and Verilog can sap all the joy out of hardware design. As part of my search for alternatives I found Chisel. While Chisel aimed to do for hardware what D tries to achieve with its design by introspection (create generic yet efficient building blocks), I found the usability of Chisel to suffer due to its life as Scala DSL.</p>

<p>I have stated before that "whenever possible I choose D for the task -- even for hardware design". This is my attempt to make good on that promise; to bring the Chisel model of hardware design to D, and all the modeling power it has to offer.</p></td>

<p>Bastiaan Veelo came to know about D shortly after it was released some sixteen years ago, while trying to write a flex/bison parser for C++ to pretty-print his code in a literate programming report. He found out the hard way that C++ is a pain to parse, and as D advertised with being developed with fast and easy parsing in mind, it quickly got his attention. Since then, he has been following D’s evolution continuously, without the opportunity to use the language professionally. Recently, he has been investing time to change that and help create that opportunity, which has led him to work on parsers once again — this time in D.</p>

<p>Bastiaan is the lead developer of a specialised program for the computer aided geometric design of ship hulls called Fairway, for the company SARC in the Netherlands.
