      Robert Schadek<span class="abstract">
<p>Nearly thirty years have passed since the release of the infamous Dragon Book by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. Since then the available memory and CPU power has grown by a factor of at least 1000 and 10000 respectively. The use of multiprocessors and fast networks has become the rule rather than the exception. Even though compiler and programming language have advanced greatly in this period of time, their basic design has not been adjusted to reflect the enormous hardware improvements.</p>

<p>In this presentation, which reflects the content of my master thesis, I present a D compiler written in D that exploits these tremendous hardware advances. To utilize multiprocessors the lexer and parser are run in different communicating threads. On top of that different semantic analysis are spread across multiple threads. To speedup compilation, by use of a cache and work distribution among a network, datastructures are created that store results, like the abstract-syntax- tree, in a consecutive chunk of memory. To remove manual labor a lexer- and parser-generator were created that use a custom library that, not only, consists of stl inspired containers.</p>

<p>Besides the conceptual architecture of this new compiler, I will report on the implementation, the use of datastructures and the lessons learned during this project with respect to compiler design as well as the D Programming Language.</p></span>

      Ben Gertzfield<span class="abstract">
<p>Modern large-scale software design often requires ever-growing team
sizes. As team size scales up, so does the amount of churn (and number
of bugs introduced) to a code base in a release. Unfortunately, the
amount of manual developer or QA testing necessary to find those bugs
scales quadratically (or worse) as N features are tested by hand in M
configurations. The solution is to keep coders, not QA, responsible
for maintaining the quality of their individual components, and to
make it trivial and fast to run just the right tests that cover the
code the coder changes. D comes pre-baked with lots of tools to make
this easier, including a standard unit testing harness, but
there'smuch more we can build on top of that to help write not only
tests for code, but code that can be tested in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>We'll discuss techniques and tools for designing large-scale
testable code in D, including unit testing, mocks, fakes, inversion of
control, and dependency injection.</p></span>

      Leandro Lucarella<span class="abstract">
Stop-the-world garbage collectors can be quite problematic for (soft)
real-time applications. The pauses introduced can be disruptive to the
point to make some applications inviable, like games or even low-latency
servers.

<p>The Concurrent D Garbage Collector (CDGC) was developed mainly to
address this issue, by making the mark phase run in parallel with the
actual application, reducing the pause times by 2 orders of magnitude.
Since our systems at sociomantic labs GmbH require to have very low
latency at all times, we've been using this collector for almost 2 years
now with good results.</p>

<p>This presentation gives a brief introduction to garbage collection,
describes original D's GC implementation details and explains how it has
been extended to do perform the mark phase in parallel. After showing
some benchmark results, shortcomings and future work and improvements
are discussed.</p></span>

      Rainer Sch&uuml;tze<span class="abstract">
<p>Though optional to some extent, garbage collection simplifies
programming considerably and is a major building block for a number of
features of the D programming language like slices and delegate
closures. The current garbage collector implemented in the D runtime
library is conservative, limiting the possibility to detect false
pointer references leading to unused memory leaking and polluting the
address space, especially in 32-bit environments.</p>

<p>This presentation describes the implementation of a precise
garbage collector for D that takes advantage of building necessary
type information at compile time via the existing RTInfo compiler
hook. Modifications to the D runtime library are discussed and
compiler modifications are proposed to support precise scanning the
data and TLS segments in addition to heap allocated memory.</p></span>

<p>Sociomantic Labs is a global leader in real-time bidding for online

but also makes extensive use of generic programming, even in
application-level code. Compile-time metaprogramming techniques have a
reputation of being akin to sorcery, incomprehensible to all but an
elite group of top-notch library developers. Yet we have found that
even developers with no prior knowledge of D have been able to master
the compile-time aspects of the language in a remarkably short period
of time.</p>

<p>This presentation will review the history of this part of the
language, to explain exactly how and why generic programming D has
become so accessible in practice. Drawing from Sociomantic's
experience with D, I'll discuss the areas where reality differs from
expectations. Accessible metaprogramming has huge implications for the
future commercial growth of D, and our real-world experience will help
the D community to further exploit this strength.</p></span>
