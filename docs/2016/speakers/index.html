Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation, interpreter engines and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.</td>

Andrei Alexandrescu coined the colloquial term "modern C++" (adapted

a collection of important C++ styles and idioms. He is also the
coauthor (with Herb Sutter) of C++ Coding Standards and the author of
The D Programming Language book. With Walter Bright, Andrei
co-designed many important features of D and authored a large part of
D's standard library. His research on Machine Learning and Natural
Language Processing completes a broad spectrum of expertise. Andrei
holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and
a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University "Politehnica"
Bucharest. He works with the D Language Foundation.</td>

<p>I am a generalist programmer, with a good grasp of computer architecture and distributed systems. I started using D around 2003, and became even more enamored with the language when ranges and range-based algorithms were introduced. I am currently pursuing my PhD, which aims to provide probabilistic timeliness guarantees in wireless networks operating in uncertain environments, such as wireless sensor networks. In my free time you might find me doing embedded systems development, creating my own CPU, or trying to come up with a generic algorithm to neatly solve a problem. Whenever possible I choose D for the task -- even for hardware design.</p></td>

I have been an active D coder and contributor to druntime, phobos, and tango, since 2007. I have worked on embedded systems, large distributed systems, and pretty much everything in between since graduating from WPI in 1998. I rewrote the D array runtime to prevent stomping of data from multiple references, and wrote a collection library (dcollections), whose red black tree implementation was copied into phobos. I’m also the author of the iopipe library - a buffer-based D pipeline library that streamlines parsing i/o from any source. Finally, I was the original proposer of the inout concept.</td>
