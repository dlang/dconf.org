              <p>Memory corruption is a pernicious and expensive problem.
              Too often scrubbing it out of code requires manual review,
              which becomes increasingly impractical as the size of code
              increases. Runtime checks are inadequate because they cannot
              prove that memory corruption cannot happen since only the test
              cases are checked. The idea is to be able to detect memory
              corruption at compile time as much as possible.</p>

              <p>D has had great success at greatly reducing many common
              forms of memory corruption, such as buffer overflows, use of
              uninitialized pointers, constructing invalid pointers, and
              dangling pointers into expired stack frames.</p>

              <p>The largest remaining category of such problems is tracking
              the lifetimes of memory objects and the references to them.
              The idea is to pair every memory allocation with exactly one
              deallocation and prevent references to a memory object
              from surviving past the lifetime of that object. This presentation
              describes the design of a memory ownership and borrowing
              system suitable for inclusion into the D language, addressing
              that category.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Walter Bright is the creator and first
              implementer of the D programming language and has implemented
              compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all
              areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers,
              code generation, interpreter engines and runtime libraries.
              Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and
              programming, is known for engaging and informative
              presentations, and provides training in compiler development
              techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also
              the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today
              over 30 years after its debut.</p>

              <p>D is a functional programming language, but nobody is
              talking about it. This should change, as functional
              programming offers many advances that are easily exploited in
              D.</p>

              <p>D is a multi-paradigm programming language, and one of those
              paradigms is functional programming. Even though functional
              programming is often considered to be a niche paradigm, it
              offers many advantages. These advantages are easily exploited in
              D. Unfortunately, functional programs are not bug free either,
              but D's unique combination of built-in unit tests, functional
              programming, and built-in code coverage allows many/most bugs to
              be caught early.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Robert Schadek received a master's degree
              in computer science at the University of Oldenburg. His master's
              thesis was titled &ldquo;DMCD A Distributed Multithreading
              Caching D Compiler&rdquo; and introduced multi-threading, among
              other optimizations, to the compiler control flow. He was a
              computer science PhD student from 2012&ndash;2018 at the
              University of Oldenburg. His PhD research focused on quorum
              systems in combination with graphs. Since 2018 he has been
              happily using D in his day job working for Symmetry
              Investments.</p>

              <p>Symmetry Integration Language (SIL) is a D-based
              domain-specific language of functional flavor. Heavily relying on
              D's reflection mechanism and its inherent plasticity, one of SIL's
              greatest achievements is its interoperability with many other
              sorts of languages and systems. This talk aims to present one of
              SIL’s extensions, called “sil-cling”, that allows transparent
              calling of C++ libraries via JIT compilation at runtime. Following
              DConf’s lightning talks tradition, this presentation will be a
              quick mix of description and demonstration of sil-cling’s
              power.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Alexandru Militaru is an MSc student at

              he used D to strengthen the security of Linux kernel modules. This
              was the subject of <a href="https://youtu.be/weRSwbZtKu0">his very

              <p>For our online version, Walter and Átila will be taking most
              questions from the livestream chat, but we'll also invite a
              limited number of participants into the conference call to ask
              their questions directly. Details will be provided at the top of
              the event.</p>

              <p>So prepare your statements and compile your queries! Walter
              and Átila are very much looking forward to them. Really. No

              <p>In this talk, Mathias will share his recent work and
              future plans related to two topics that are core to D.</p>

              <p>First and foremost, parameter passing: how the current
              defaults affect us and the issues they bring. This includes the
              recently added `-preview=in`, an experimental feature that
              landed in D v2.094.0, and which attempts to redefine input
              parameters.</p>

              <p>The second part will focus on an issue that every library
              developer should be familiar with: how delegates and attributes
              are often at odds, and how writing good library code to support
              them is not currently possible. Finally, Mathias will show
              how a simple language addition could help solve this
              problem.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Mathias Lang started his journey with D
              in 2012 while looking for a language which could quench his
              metaprogramming thirst. After a few years at Sociomantic Labs,
              he is now CTO for <a
              href="https://bosagora.io">https://bosagora.io</a>, developing a
              blockchain project in D.</p>

              <p>Átila gives some background on his view of programming language
              design and how he spends his time. He has organized his thoughts
              into four main topics: why he and Walter care about
              <code>@safe</code>, his belief in the "less is more" principle,
              the projects he'd like to be working on, and the projects he's
              actually working on.
              </p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Átila Neves has a PhD in Particle Physics
              for research done at CERN. Most of the time spent there required
              programming in C++, with a two-year stint as a Perl programmer
              on the IT department's security team. He also worked for Cisco
              for almost seven years, developing networking software in C and
              C++ and leading his teams in the areas of software quality and
              testing. He now works as a D consultant/programmer for Symmetry
              Investments, as well as being the deputy maintainer of the D
              programming language. He spends his spare time yelling at the
              screen in frustration while waiting for computers to compile his
              code.</p>

              <code>@trusted</code> code (which should be all D coders!).
              Steve will go over memory safety and how D's related attributes
              can be used, with a focus on the interaction between
              <code>@safe</code> and <code>@trusted</code>. It's actually easy
              to write code that's tagged <code>@safe</code> that isn't
              actually memory safe, thanks to the possibility that
              <code>@safe</code> and
              <code>@trusted</code> code can be written with different
              semantic expectations on the same data. Steve will dig into this
              through the example of a tagged union implementation.</p>

              <p>The D programming language offers a plethora of compile-time
              features which allow for metaprogramming and code generation,
              and which have seen increased usage over time. As a side effect, D
              programmers who use these features have found themselves facing
              increased compile times.</p>

              <p>In this talk, Stefan will dig into DMD's internals to provide
              context on this phenomenon. Through code examples, he'll show
              what can cause increased compile times and how to make them
              faster. He'll preview work that's currently being done to
              improve the situation and discuss future directions.</p>

              personally and professionally since 2013. He has taken a special

              been contibuting to DMD for over four years. He has presented
              either a full talk or a lightning talk at three DConfs and is
