      <p>
        We're at CodeNode in London once again from August 29 &ndash; September 1, 2023, for the D Programming
        Language Conference, sponsored by Symmetry Investments and hosted by the D Language Foundation. This is our
        third time in London, thanks to Symmetry&#8217;s support, and we&#8217;re thrilled to be back! <a
          href="https://dconf.org/2022/">DConf &#8216;22 at CodeNode</a> was a huge success, with overwhelmingly
        positive feedback from attendees. In fact, it was the best one yet, and we&#8217;re committed to making DConf
        &#8216;23 even better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can't be there in person? No problem! Join our livestreams during the three days of talks and ask questions

        DConf is the premier meetup event for the D programming language community. Although we continue to hold regular
        online meetups, nothing compares to the energy and camaraderie of face-to-face interactions. At DConf, both
        seasoned veterans and first-time attendees, and many in between, come together for four days of education,
        knowledge sharing, and fun. We can&#8217;t wait to do it all again!

                <p>Are you feeling the weight of uncertainty in the programming world as the D Language grapples with
                challenges amidst the rise of competing languages? There's a looming concern that these hurdles might
                hold D back from its true potential, relegating it to a lower standing. The cost of letting this happen
                is significant, not just for D enthusiasts but for the entire programming community. Yet, a solution
                exists; a way to steer D towards the path of popularity and influence it deserves. There is an
                unexpected approach to unlocking the value behind the language, and the result will shape D's future and
                elevate your own personal and professional success. Don't miss out on this discourse that promises to
                transform your perspective on what DLF means to all of us.</p>

                <p>Like many modern programming languages, D has a static type system and
                  built-in tuple support. In this talk, I will present general design
                  considerations around type systems, with a particular focus on D&#8217;s
                  type system, recent developments in D, and possible avenues for
                  further improving the soundness, expressiveness, and ergonomics of D.
                  As some operations on tuples remain rather clunky in today&#8217;s D, this
                  will in particular include design considerations around tuples and a
                  number of different proposals for how to move forward.</p>

                DMD development and contributed the initial implementation of static

                <p>The absence of a proper compiler library has been haunting the D ecosystem since
                  forever. Although progress has been made in creating a public API, there is a lot of
                  room for improvement. In this talk, I will discuss the major challenges of
                  developing a proper compiler interface for DMD-as-a-library, what has been done so
                  far, what are the future plans, and what will be the limitations.</p>

                <p>Should D have a smarter Garbage Collector, or support Reference Counting? I
                  don&#8217;t care. Stack memory is where it&#8217;s at! D is really good at it with its static
                  arrays, slices, and DIP1000&#8217;s lifetime tracking to make it all memory-safe.
                  DIP1000 has evolved a lot in its design and implementation, so I&#8217;ll get you up to
                  speed with where we are now and how we got here.

                <p>DIP1000 adds quite a bit of syntax to the language and makes D look a lot less
                  beautiful, in my opinion. Instead of trying to add things to the language, why not
                  take a look at things that need to be removed to achieve the same level of memory
                  safety? This talk shows how to remove three things from the language to make it
                  memory-safe and still live with the consequences.</p>

                <p>C is the lingua franca of programming languages. Chances are, if
                  something exists in the world of computer science, there is a version of it
                  in C. But what if you use D? The great news is that any C project is almost
                  trivially accessible via D. But what if you hate the problems that come with
                  C? No overloading! No operators! Zero-terminated strings! Manual memory
                  management! No memory safety! Many of these things led me to undertake a
                  project of porting a quite broad and well-used C library to D. What might be
                  in store for you if you decide to take this journey? Tune in to find out!

                <p>When building software services using D, a practical reality is that most other
                  services are not also using D. A fairly standard way of inter-service
                  communication is accomplished via a REST Architecture, based on JSON over HTTPS,
                  for example. However, writing a new client for every programming language is
                  error-prone and labor intensive. The internals of the OpenAPI Client library are
                  discussed showing how D Client code can be generated using mixins and templates
                  from OpenAPI specifications, permitting compatibility with well known APIs such as
                  Slack, Stripe, or OpenAI.</p>

                code, optimized code, clever code, user-friendly code, structured code, effective code, etc. Everybody

                writing code that is hard to understand. I&#8217;ll show how D makes it easy to write easy-to-understand
                code. It won&#8217;t cost anything, either. And who knows? Maybe your future self will sigh contentedly with
                &#8220;I wrote that!&#8221;</p>
                <p>The highest praise you can get for your code is someone else looking at it saying &#8220;that&#8217;s so

                its build system, the presence of a package manager, and how all of this could lead to

                <p>In January of 2023, I excitedly showed a group of over 110 university students
                  that D is the 48th most popular programming language on the Tiobe Index (for
                  whatever its metrics are)&mdash;and then told those students they would be
                  learning D in the software engineering course that semester. In this talk, I will
                  recap my university curriculum of how I taught D, and why I think D should be
                  taught by more faculty in universities. For this software engineering course, we
                  made use of low-level access, multiple programming paradigms, built-in profilers,
                  package management (dub), code coverage, ddoc, and unit testing in order to build a
                  half-semester long project. My conclusion is that using D at university can give
                  students a competitive advantage versus other languages, and in this talk I&#8217;ll
                  reflect on the curriculum, pain points, strengths, and future of D in

                  Engineering with Professor Mike Shah at Northeastern University. During the first
                  class, it was announced that the course would be taught in D. This talk will
                  follow the perspective of four students (one group) in said course, beginning with
                  their experience learning the D programming language.</p>

                <p>The main portion will discuss the creation and implementation of the
                  half-semester long final project: an interactive networked whiteboard application
                  with a couple of features (chat, brushes). Various tools and add-ons this project
                  used were <a href="https://gtkd.org/">GtkD</a>, networking, package management (dub), code coverage, and unit
                  testing (<a href="https://code.dlang.org/packages/unit-threaded">unit-threaded</a>). To conclude, this

                <p>Different hardware architectures implement different memory models. This in
                  turn makes porting multi-threaded software between different target architectures
                  an insanely complicated task. To solve this problem, C++11 introduced a language
                  memory model that was later adopted by other languages such as D and Rust.</p>

                <p>In this talk, we&#8217;ll present the C++11 memory model, including multiple options
                  for atomic accesses that lie on the trade-off between performance and the
                  consistency level they support. Due to the well known complexities and pitfalls in
                  this kind of programming, we will also consider several safe patterns to work with
                  atomic variables that lower the chances of introducing bugs.</p>

                <p>Multiplix is an operating system written in D under development for a research
                  project at Stanford University. Kernel code is an unusual setting where there
                  is no surrounding infrastructure, thus requiring hand-written assembly, a
                  specialized build process, and custom implementations for core features like
                  memory allocation and concurrency primitives. This talk will explain how we are
                  using D for OS development, and show examples of how to write bare-metal D
                  code. The talk will go over the architecture of Multiplix with an emphasis on
                  how the D language has shaped it. I&#8217;ll also discuss our experiences using D for
                  kernel development, and the benefits and challenges that arise from using D in

                <p>QUIC is a new, standardized and widely adopted internet protocol.
                  A native library within the D ecosystem would pave the way towards HTTP/3
                  adoption. Furthermore, it would remove the reliance on bindings to third party C
                  implementations and would facilitate the use of features like D exceptions and
                  fiber-based concurrency.</p>

                <p>This talk aims to present my progress on bringing QUIC
                  to the D environment. I will talk about why someone might consider using QUIC
                  over other protocols. I will present the challenges that I encountered and how
                  the solutions reflect into the design of quic-d. I think that the requirements
                  of QUIC framing/packetization and streams made an interesting case of using D&#8217;s
                  features, like introspection. I will conclude by presenting some possible

                <p>I will talk about my journey learning AI, what I&#8217;ve discovered about it, the
                  ins and outs most people do not understand, and how I did it all purely in D.
                  I was able to implement neural networks to do a variety of tasks, such as text
                  and color recognition. I&#8217;ve created my own neural network creator software,
                  which in turn was also written in D.

                <p>Even in their infancy, large language models like ChatGPT are the talk
                  of the town. Until recently, LLMs have been inferenced (run) using huge
                  chunks of Python code, but recent interest has brought about some
                  much simpler, specialized, libraries written in native languages
                  (llama.cpp being a recently famous example). I will discuss how to
                  talk to these using D and also demonstrate some home-grown approaches
                  we have in D, including one by yours truly.</p>

                <h3 class="innerhdr">Hackathon</h3>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon has been part of every edition of DConf since 2017 in Berlin when Sebastian
                  Wilzbach suggested we extend the conference by one day to work on D projects. A number of
                  attendees worked on bugs, some tutored others on various D features, and one (Timon Gehr) used the
                  time to implement a new feature (<code>static foreach</code>).</p>
                <p>Use your time at the Hackathon the way you feel is best for you: submit PRs to the core D
                  repositories or your favorite projects in the broader ecosystem; hack on your own project, and
                  maybe enlist some help from a fellow attendee to work through a tough problem; tutor a novice D
                  programmer, or seek tutoring from someone more experienced; corner Walter or √Åtila and rant to
                  them about your biggest D pet peeve(s); or just sit and chat with the people around you.</p>
                <p>This year, we&#8217;re planning a special event to take place during the morning
                  session, open to anyone who&#8217;d like to join. We&#8217;ll post the details here once we&#8217;re ready to announce.
                </p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is also open to the general public. If you are in the area on September 1st and
                  didn&#8217;t register for the conference, that&#8217;s okay. Join us anyway! If you registered, invite a
                  friend or relative, maybe someone who knows very little about our favorite programming
                  language&mdash;there are fewer times as opportune as this one to show them what it&#8217;s all
                  about.</p>
                <p>The DConf Hackathon is a great time to ramp up some work or wind down from three days of talks.
                  It&#8217;s your time, so use it as you will. See you there!</p>
                <h3 class="innerhdr">Finding Your IVY</h3>
                <p>Some in the D community will have already heard of the concept of IVY (Ideal Vision of Yourself) from the D Language Foundation's
                  announcement that they went through an organizational development program courtesy of Ucora. DConf attendees will hear more about
                  it from Ucora&#8217;s Saeed Sabeti in his opening keynote and during the Ask Us Anything session. The TL;DR: IVY is a different take on the well-known concept
                  of a vision statement, geared in part toward finding opportunities for collaboration that might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
                <p>During the Hackathon, Saeed, along with Mike Parker, will be available for group sessions aimed at going more in-depth about the IVY
                  concept and assisting those interested in learning how to discover their personal IVY statements. They will host up to four hour-long sessions
                  as needed, starting at 09:30, 11:00, 13:30, and 15:00.</p>
                <p>Anyone interested in learning how they can benefit from IVY and how the D Language Foundation is employing it is encouraged to
                  join one of the sessions. Just let Mike Parker know at any point before or during DConf and he will get you sorted.</p>

      <p>Every evening during the first three nights of DConf means only one thing: BeerConf! <a
      href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">Ethan Watson coined the term</a> in 2016 as a name for
      what happens at the designated evening gathering spot at every DConf. In 2019 and 2022, we
      were able to hire space at pubs for BeerConf. Unfortunately, pub hire rates are well beyond
      our budget this year, so we&#8217;re going back to what we used to do and designating a hotel where
      everyone can gather.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MdtDYXmt8GSLFYmm6">Travelodge London Central City Road</a>
        is tentatively designated the DConf &#8216;23 BeerConf spot. They have a restaurant/lounge
        on the ground floor which serves beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and snacks. Despite the
        name, drinking beer is not required to particpate. Come and go as you please each evening.
        Chat and talk about D, about programming, about life, or whatever comes up. BeerConf is an
        excellent way to unwind after a day of DConf!

        hosts of DConf &#8216;23. With offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Jersey, and the Cayman Islands, Symmetry
        employs D in their investment management mission. This is the third time they&#8217;ve sponsored DConf, and we
        are thankful for their continued support. They are also the sponsors of the <a
          href="https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/">Symmetry Autumn of Code</a>, an annual event that,
        since 2018, has provided experience to emerging programmers while enhancing the D ecosystem. We couldn&#8217;t
        be more excited to bring DConf to London once again with Symmetry&#8217;s support.</p>
