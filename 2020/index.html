            <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">June 17&ndash;20, 2020 at 99 City Road</span s>
        </div>
        <p>DConf is the largest meetup of D Programming Language enthusiasts on the planet. Professional and amateur programmers from all over the world come together
          to share their experiences, build and maintain relationships, and expand their knowledge through three days of presentations, capping it all off on the
          fourth day with a round of collaborative hacking on D projects and solving D problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Keynote Speakers</h3>

        </div>
        <p>As always, one of three keynote speakers will open each day of the conference.
          Walter Bright, the BDFL of D, will be back for his 8th consecutive annual DConf
          keynote. This year he'll be joined by Átila Neves. Though it won't be Átila's first
          DConf talk, it will be his first keynote in his new role as co-maintainer of D.
        </p>
        <p>We're excited that <strong>our invited keynote speaker this year is Roberto Ierusalimschy</strong>, the leading architect of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">the Lua programming
           language</a> since 1993. He's also the author of <a href="https://store.feistyduck.com/products/programming-in-lua-fourth-edition-ebook">Programming in Lua</a>
           and an <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/">Associate Professor of Computer Science at PUC-Rio</a> (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro).
        </p>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar quote">
          <p><i>DConf has become the anchoring event that has me
            inspired and motivated for the whole year. We are a unique programming
            language community in that we're entirely decentralized geographically.
            Even the leadership is spread all over across the two US coasts, Western
            Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia. Therefore, the event that brings us
            all together is powerful - an annual systole of the live, beating heart
            of a great community.</i></p>

        <p>DConf 2020 is hosted by <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">our friends at Symmetry Investments</a>. With offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, and London,
          Symmetry employs D in their investment management mission. This is the second time they've hosted a DConf&mdash;their first go in 2019 was a smashing success.
          They have also twice sponsored the <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/"></a>Symmetry Autumn of Code</a>, an event that provides experience
          to emerging programmers while enhancing the D ecosystem. We couldn't be more thrilled to be working with Symmetry in bringing DConf to London once again.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to help us put more of your registration fee toward conference expenses, you can do so by clicking on the image on the left above to sign up through <a href="https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NzQ0NzA=">our registration form at Flipcause</a>. Here, you'll have the option of paying the credit card processing fee. Even if you uncheck the option so that we cover the fee, you'll still be helping us out.</p>

        <p>We offer registration via PayPal in both USD and GBP. The GBP option allows you to register at a fixed amount, based on the current HMRC monthly exchange rate, rather than relying on the variable exchange rates used by PayPal or your credit card provider (where applicable).</p>

        <h3>Discounted Rates</h3>
        <p>We offer a 50% discount off the regular registration rate to students, academics, and major open source contributors. If you think you qualify, please contact
          <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>
        for details.</p>
        <p>If you will be in or around London June 17&ndash;20 and would like to attend DConf but can't afford the registration fee, please contact
          <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>!
        We don't want anyone who really wants to attend DConf to miss it simply because they can't afford to register. Let us know your situation and we'll be happy to work something out with you.

            Call For Submissions
        </h1>
        <p>We are currently accepting submissions for papers, talks, demos, panels, or research reports for DConf 2020. The topics of choice are anything and everything related to the D language, such as:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Language techniques</strong> enabled by the D language</li>
        <li><strong>Tools and techniques</strong> for maximizing productivity when working in D</li>
        <li><strong>Experience reports</strong> on using D in the real world</li>
        <li><strong>Under the hood</strong> looks at compiler and standard library implementation artifacts</li>
        <li><strong>Hot topics</strong> such as safe deterministic memory management, migrating from other languages, or community engagement</li>
        <li><strong>Research reports</strong> by students doing research on or using the D language</li>
        </ul>
        But don't feel constrained! Originality in topics and formats is warmly encouraged. If it is relevant to the D language, it fits. This year, we're
        especially interested in submissions from first-time DConf speakers. Whether your past submissions have been rejected or you've never
        submitted to DConf at all, don't let it hold you back! We want you to send us your ideas. Just please mind the following guidelines.</p>

        <h3 class= w3-padding">Selection Criteria</h3>
        <p>We expect original work, or work synthesized from community folklore into interesting tidbits by the author. Related work can be mentioned with
          credit. Overviews of an area covered by other authors is acceptable, again with due credit and assuming the overview has intrinsic value. Additionally,
          the selection committee will review and rate submissions according to the following criteria:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is the topic interesting to DConf attendees? Will a coverage be beneficial? Is it building on tried and true ideas, or,
          on the contrary, blazing new trails?</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Does the proposal cover the topic in depth? What are the main insights dispensed by the submission?</li>
        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Is the submission well organized? Will the audience tune into the narrative?</li>
        <li><strong>Novelty and Originality:</strong> How new and noteworthy is the material? Previously published material is acceptable provided it hasn't
          reached a wide audience within the D community yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> What's your session's takeaway? How is it going to improve the attendees' knowledge, outlook, and inspiration?</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3 class= w3-padding">Submission Guidelines</h3>
        <p>We expect submissions in plain text format or one of the usual rich document formats, such as PDF or DOC. All submissions should be directed to
          <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>
          and should include:
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Title</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Kind</strong> (e.g., talk, panel, contest)</li>
        <li><strong>Duration</strong> (we're aiming for 50-minute presentations, but will consider shorter and longer durations)</li>
        <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> the "elevator pitch" of the talk, in one paragraph</li>
        <li><strong>Extended description:</strong> an extended abstract including any details you believe are relevant for evaluating the submission</li>
        <li><strong>Brief speaker biograph</strong> including a summary of the speaker's expertise relative to the talk topic</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword tags</strong></li>
        </ol>
        We can't wait to see what you send us!</p>

          London Tech City near the Old Street tube and rail stations, it's operated by <a href="https://www.inmarsat.com">Inmarsat</a>, a global satellite
          communications firm. The venue is equipped to meet the needs of technology-oriented conferences. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the food is
          excellent! Combined with easy access to public transportation and a variety of nearby hotels, it's an excellent location for DConf 2020.</p>

        <p>All of the talks will be live streamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNdmeE-_lS6VhCVydkVvQ">our YouTube channel</a> by Inmarsat's
          A/V staff so that those unable to join us can view them anywhere in the world. And thanks to the excellent job they did last year,
          <a href="">Stage Engage</a> will once again be recording all talks separately from the live

        <p>Inmarsat has relationships with several local hotels allowing discounts for conference attendees. Upon registration, every DConf attendee will
          receive information on how to take advantage of these offers. Anyone who submits a talk and would like to wait until after the author notification
          date to register, please send an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> for details.</p>

        <p>Even with the discounts, the partner hotels may be rather pricey. For those looking for cheaper alternatives, there are at least three budget hotels
          within walking distance:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/greater-london/london/london-city-old-street.html?cid=GLBC_LONOLD">
          Premier Inn London City (Old Street)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/340/London-Central-City-Road-hotel">Travelodge London Central City Road</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.thezhotels.com/shoreditch">The Z Hotel Shoreditch</a></li>
        </ul>

        Other budget hotels can be found within a longer walking distance or a short tube ride away. There are numerous hostels to choose from as well.</p>
